# SDV503-Lab-Six-Nicole-Asti

Both students will work using the same repository that they will set up themselves by completing the following:
One of the pair code students will create a new repository name "SDV503-Lab-Six-Students_Names".
 the repository must contain the following:
README file.
MIT license.
Src folder with an index.js file.
A journal.md file for each student. (EX: student-name.md)
package.json. (Type npm init -y  in your VScode terminal and make sure you have the correct path)
Install nodemon. (Type npm i -g nodemon in your VScode terminal and make sure you have the correct path)
The student that created the lab repository needs to add the pair coder student as a collaborator.
Each pair of code students will clone the lab repository on their laptops.
One of the pair coding students needs to take responsibility for the workflow. (Ex: creating branches, git commits, commits pushes and pulls)
Create a new branch and name it "develop."
Create a branch for each task(question) from the develop branch.
After finishing the task(question), you will merge the branch back to develop branch.
The repository must have committed from both pair coders.
Pair coders must set up a communication channel via teams to continue work after class hours.
Task (Questions) :

### ​Task_1:  
Create a function that returns the total of all odd numbers up to and including the given arugrment. 
The argument will be given as an odd number when you invoke the function. 
Ex:  addOddNumbers(5)  -> 9  // 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Ex: addOddnumbers(13) -> 49 // 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 49
### Task_2: 
Create a function that takes an array of non-negative integers and strings and return a new array without the strings.
Ex:  filterArr([1, 2, "a", "b"]) -> [1, 2]
Ex:  filterArr([1, 2, "aasf", "1", "123", 123]) ➞ [1, 2, 123]
Note: The given array only has integers and strings.
Note: Numbers in the array should not repeat.
Note: The original order must be maintained.
### Task_3: 
Given an object containing counts of both likes and dislikes of a facebook post, return a number of count for either likes or dislikes should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of dislikes from likes.
Ex:  getCount({ likes: 13, dislikes: 0 }) -> 13
Ex:  getCount({ likes: 2, dislikes: 23 }) -> -21
Ex:  getCount({ likes: 100, dislikes: 100 }) -> 0
Note: The argument gets passed in the form of an object
Note: This object get assigned to the variable name "counts"
Note: the function body want something to operate on , which is going to be the properties of the object "counts" , so you access the properties of this object with dot notation by counts.property_1 and counts.property_2
Submission Instruction, Due Date & Time:

Pair coders will start Lab Six in class. (Tue13th of April 9:30AM) 
Due date of submission will be on Wed 14th of April 11:59PM.
Each pair coder will submit the same lab repository url and zip folder individually via dropbox.
Each pair coder student needs to make sure provide a journal.md (student-name.md) on the develop branch.
