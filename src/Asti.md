### Week Eight - Lab Six - Objects & Functions
This week we practised pair-coding and expanded on objects and functions. 
Pair-coding requires one "driver" and one "navigator". The driver is responsible for writing the code and the navigator ensures the code is going the way it needs to. These roles are a bit varied at our stage of learning, when neither person quite knows exactly what they're doing, and so we both used our existing knowledge to research the tasks set for us to accomplish. 

## Pair-coding
Pair-coding is great for expanding on git skills and teamwork as it requires people to work together and ensure that completed work is accessible and doesn't get deleted. By needing separate branches it is good practice for when to commit, push and pull data from the repository. Having a team of people to work with provides a good knowledge base, if someone is unsure of something they are able to discuss it with their peer and have support to persevere through difficult tasks.

## Objects
Objects are a data type that can contain many different kinds of data. They are useful for storing many properties in a specific container, as well as, providing a layout to re-use code for similar tasks. There are different ways to create an object, these include creating the object using a variable
```javascript
let colours = {
red : 'red',
blue : 'blue'
};
```
Or using an object method such as Object.create(), or new Object()
```javascript
const blah = Object.create(speech);
```
As Javascript is object-oriented it's crucial to understand how objects work and their purpose moving forward.
